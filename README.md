# Fake news detection
Fake news has become one of the most pressing issues in today’s digital world. With social media and online platforms, misinformation can spread faster than ever before — influencing public opinion, creating confusion, and sometimes even leading to real-world consequences.

This project aims to tackle that problem by using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically detect whether a given news article is real or fake. The system learns from past examples of real and fake news, understands patterns in the text, and makes predictions on new data.
